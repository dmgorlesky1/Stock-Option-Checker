The purpose of this program is to see what stocks have options currently.

Future Work:
------------
-Check last trading day if the stock had options, if not print to a text document the ticker name and a description of why it was added.
-Check if the options went from Monthly to Weekly or vis versa
-Check for stocks that increase price cap
