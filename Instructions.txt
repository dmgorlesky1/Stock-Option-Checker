This is the instructions on how to set up and properly use this program.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
SETUP:
------
1. Downlaod Thonny, it's a program that allows for you use run Python code, which is what this program is. 
    -It's easier to set it to having a desktop icon. Link: (https://thonny.org/)
2. Download all the files into a folder on your desktop. (Download as Zip folder, move to desktop, extract all)
    -Hit the green 'Code' button, then below it it says "Download Zip"
3. When you open Thonny you'll need to do a few things. For starters, open up the two programs.
    3a. Hit file in the top left corner, hit open, then find the folder you put on your desktop.
        -You'll have to open 2 programs. 1 named OptionsStock.py and another named readFile.py
        
        *** IMPORTANT ***
            -The readFile.py program is where the finalTickers csv(excel) file comes from. It removes all unwanted tickers
                so we only get common stocks from both NYSE and NASDAQ.
            -This program only needs to be ran whenever new stock lists are generated from the NYSE and NASDAQ.   
                * Use this website: ```https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/screener?exchange=NYSE&render=download``` *
                -Download the NYSE list and replace the file called NYSEFile.csv (Name must match)
                -Download the NASDAQ list and replace the file called NASDAQ.csv (Name must match)
            
            -The OptionsStock.py is where everything is actually done. The results after running this program will go into the file
                called newOptions.txt
                *** DO NOT REPLACE OR TOUCH THE prevLogs.CSV FILE THIS IS WHERE THE TICKER DATA IS KEPT ***
    
    3b. Once you have the files open, in the top bar hit "Tools" -> "Manage packages"
        -Download these packages.
            -> pandas (not panda, different thing, the 's' is important)
            -> yahoo-fin (This allows us to get stock data)
            
4. Everything should be set up now. In order to run each program, hit the Green Arrow at the top under "View"
      *** NOTE: If the program gets stuck (isn't showing new tickers), hit the "STOP" button. Make sure the data in prevLogs.csv is okay (not empty).
          -> If it's fine, continue. If not, go to the "Recover Data" section below.
          
 *** Note: In order to let users see it's working, I have it printing the tickers number and the tickers as they are happening. This can be viewed on the console at the bottom.
      ->If you do not have a window at the bottom of Thonny saying "Shell", simply go to "Run" and click "Run current script" ***
      
      
Data Recovery:
--------------
If you're here something must've happened to your data. There are a few areas you'll need to check to make sure it's okay before doing anything else.
1. Check that both NYSEFile.csv AND NASDAQFile.csv have things in them!
    ->May need to try redownloading them if something happened
2. Check finalTickers.csv and that it also isn't empty. (If this happpens, it was caused in the readFile.py program. Try rerunning it after redownloading the 2 csv files above.
3. Check prevLogs.csv. This is what is changed each time the program is ran.
    ->If prevLog is empty do these steps:
        a) Click and drag until a blue background has covered lines 53-75 (see line numbers on the left side of Thonny).
        b) Hit Ctrl-#
        c) Go down to line 108 and at the very beginning, hit #. This should cause the entire line to be greyed out. I've added a "<------------" so you can find it.
        d) Go back up to lines 39-42 and remove the # symbol for each line. NOTE: Careful on line 39, there is an extra space you also have to remove!!!!!!!!!
        e) Run the program.
        f) Make sure prevLogs.csv now has the tickers in column A and "N" in column B.
        g) UNDO ALL CHANGES
            -> Hit Ctrl-Z (undo button) until lines 53-75 are uncommented. DO NOT HIT AGAIN, IT MAY ALTER THE PROGRAM AND BREAK IT.
        h) The program should be fine to run again in its entirety.
        
        
FINAL NOTES:
------------
IF YOU EVER WANT TO CHANGE WHAT DATA IS BEING FILTERED, EITHER ASK ME OR FOLLOW THESE STEPS
1. If you want to change the cost of each stock to be more or less than $100, go into readFile, on line 66, change the '100' what desired number
2. If you wish to undo some filters, this is where it gets complicated.
    -> If you wish to delete a filter, look above at lines 17-29 and see which one you'd like to remove and it's name (left side of the '=')
    -> Find that name below and delete the line
    -> Now, if you try and run the program you get an indentation error. Instead, highlight lines 45-72 and hit tab. This auto indents them correctly.
    -> Now you can run the program again.
    
    
Information about Files:
------------------------
All of my data for tickers on the NYSE and NASDAQ come from https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/screener?exchange=NYSE&render=download

The NYSEFile.csv holds all the tickers on the NYSE exchange. 
The NASDAQ.csv holds all the tickers on the NASDAQ exchange. 
The finalTickers.csv holds all the filtered tickers 
The previousLog.csv file will hold the data of each ticker from the last time the program was ran. 
The tempFile.csv will hold the updated values that will then overwrite previousLog (don't want data lost or overwritten as I'm reading).

-> The newOptions.txt file holds the tickers that now have options that didn't previously. (THIS IS THE FILE YOU LOOK AT THE SEE THE RESULTS AFTER THE PROGRAM RAN)
